## Supported languages

For many languages, the software should work right out of the box.  Even your language isn't one of the 30-some languages that are explicitly listed, you can set the language setting to Undetermined (und) and it can usually make good guesses about what each letter sounds like.  (This even works for many non-Roman alphabets like Cyrillic or Arabic or Syllabics.)  

However, it will generally guess based on "typical" pronunciations of those letters across lots of languages.  If you language uses familiar letters but in unfamiliar ways, the software may have trouble guessing.

Let's consider to example languages, Spanish and Irish Gaelic.

* Even if you don't speak Spanish, you could probably be given a word like "Domingo" or "zapatos" and make a pretty good guess at how it's pronounced, because Spanish uses its letters in a pretty cross-linguistically ordinary way.  You might not be able to pronounce it correctly, but if you heard it in a recording, you could probably recognize it.

* On the other hand, consider Irish Gaelic.  If someone gave you the word "mhaith", how would you pronounce that?  It's something more like "va" or "wa"!  You would absolutely never guess that if you didn't know Irish Gaelic, and nor will our software.  

So you have to ask yourself, "Is my language more like Spanish, or more like Irish?"

(Even if it's not in Roman letters.  If your language uses another alphabet, but it uses the letters in mostly the same way as other languages that use that alphabet, it'll probably work.  Or if you're the only language that uses that alphabet, it'll probably work.  It's mostly languages that use familiar alphabets in unfamiliar ways that don't work.)

Anyway, we suggest, if your language isn't already supported by the software, to try using the Undetermined (und) setting and see how well that works.  If it works very poorly, but there's a language that's written in a very similar language to yours (e.g. a neighboring language), give that a try next.  If it doesn't work with "und", and there's no similar-enough language, send us an email after the workshop and we'll discuss adding a language-specific pronunciation chart for your language.

Other languages that may not work well are ones where vowels aren't written and you have to figure them out based on context, like Arabic and Hebrew.  The software just isn't smart enough to add in unwritten vowels in a language it doesn't know.  It also won't work well in languages where one symbol can have completely different readings depending on context, like in Japanese.  The software can't know when "山" is pronounced as "san" vs. "yama", let alone completely unpredictable stuff like "小豆" being pronounced "azuki" rather than "shōzu".

For languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese, there's not a whole lot we can do because learning how to pronounce sentences these languages *is* a very hard, language-specific problem that requires understanding what the sentence means in order to understand how it's pronounced.  That's a LOT harder than what our software does.  You can contact us to discuss what to do about them, but for the most part it'll involve you finding or writing a language-specific program to guess pronunciations, it's outside of what we can realistically concentrate on.
